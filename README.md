## la1
Simple message from client side to server side. Messages must be sent one at a time alternating between the server and the client.

## la2
Given a web url, follow any redirects and then print out the webpage headers and url content.

## la3
A multi-threaded chat server that allows uniquely named users to connect to a server and chat. Upon connecting to the server, a server wide announcement is made of the user log in.
Clients can then choose to chat privately with other clients.
Clients also given a list of options they can use to interact with the server:
* logout: removes the client from the server
* update: manually updates the client list
* off: turns off the automatic client update
* dnd: sets a do not disturb for that client and automatically denies chat requests
* dndoff: turns off the dnd, if client was in dnd mode

## la4
My implementation of TCP strategies such as Duplicate ACK, Fast Recovery, Congestion Avoidance, CWND, and SSTHRESH.

## la5
My implementation of Dijkstra's and Distance Vector algorithms
